Qiwur Nutch is based on Apache Nutch 2.3.0, with awesome features : 


1. Crowdsourcing crawl support

2. Ajax support

3. Humanoid bot

4. Better system counters

5. Better web UI


This project works together with the other two relative projects : 
satellite : https://github.com/galaxyeye/satellite

qiwur-ui : https://github.com/galaxyeye/qiwur-ui

Project satellite is a fetcher client based on phantomjs, which visits
the target web site just like real human being.

Project qiwur-nutch-ui is a PHP based WEB UI for nutch.


To run crawler using crowdsourcing mode : 

1. make sure you are familiar with Apache Nutch

2. modify nutch-site.xml, set "fetcher.fetch.mode" to be "crowdsourcing", 
   set "nutch.master.host" to be the machine you run nutch server

3. start satellite on any machine follow satellite's README. Satellite is desinged to
   run on any cheap PC, it acts as a "normal browser" just like you visit a website
   using chrome

4. you can run crawl locally following the Apache Nutch's official guide, using command line.
   when the fetch job runs, it also starts nutch server if necessary. Once nutch server
   is running, the satellite will ask nutch server for tasks.

   you can also run nutch server using ./bin/nutch nutchserver, if so, you need 
   nutch ui project to start a crawl, note : currently, nutch ui project is not only
   used just for nutch, but also used for other propurse, just ignore the 
   functionalties has no relativity with nutch.
